  My name is Jessica Montabaranom. I am 21 years old and I currently live in the North East of England. I am based in Hull half the year as I am a second year student at the University of Hull, studying a BSc Marine Biology (Hons).
</p>
<p> I have always been an outdoorsy and adventurous person. My family and I travelled and moved around a lot when I was younger, and I was lucky enough to discover and fully immerse myself into many different countries and cultures. I am also lucky enough to be bilingual, having an English parent and a French parent, and living in France for 10 years. Despite living the French Alps, I was drawn to the ocean from a young age and grew up in family that was environmentally conscious and spoke openly about climate change.
</p>
<p> I've known for a long time that I wanted to help protect the Earth and its oceans, and participate in actions against climate change and in promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.
