  <p>
  My name is Jessica Montabaranom and I am currently going into my third year of BSc Marine Biology at the University of Hull.
</p>
<p>
  After taking a course in coding in my second year at university, I decided to create my own website as a portfolio to document my journey of becoming a marine biologist and increasingly passionate about the oceans and its wildlife. I have a particular interest in marine mammals and seize every opportunity to learn more about them and spend time with them. I am also very interested in protecting the oceans and their conservation, as I believe humans would not survive without them. I actively promote a more sustainable lifestyle and try to develop my knowledge on the causes, short-term and long-term effects of climate change.
</p>
<p>
  I have been lucky enough to have opportunities to discover the marine wildlife and aid in conservation in the UK and abroad. You can check these out in my experiences page.
</p>
<p>
  This website is still under development and may not be completely finished when youâ€™re browsing through it. It will always be a work in progress as I plan on gaining more experiences and documenting further skills I improve on and obtain.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact with the link provided on the contact page.
</p>
<p>
  I hope you enjoy browsing through my website, and I hope it might inspire you to promote marine conservation and learn a little more about the oceans too.
